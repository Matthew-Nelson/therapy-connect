## How to Use

**Getting Started**

To use Therapy Connect, you must create an account as either a therapist or as a client.

**Connecting With a Therapist**

Once a client has created an account and logged in, they will need to add themselves to their therapist's network with the given form field. This way the therapist can see who they need to be giving routines to!

**Creating a Routine**

Creating routines is easy! The given forms will allow therapists to create what workouts they want their clients doing next. This allows therapists to have detailed control over what routines their clients are following and allows them to customize routines in between visits to the office.

**Completing a routine**

Once the therapist has assigned a client their next routine, it will be waiting in their profile. Once a client has completed their workout, they simply hit the "complete workout" and it will be cleared from their profile.
